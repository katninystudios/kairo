# About
Kairo is a browser created by Katniny Studios, an independent, privacy-first development studio.

Kairo was created as a better privacy-focused alternative to browsers, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc. but without crap that even the best alternatives add, like AI, Crypto, etc.

Learn more about Kairo [here](/ABOUT.md).

# What Engine is Kairo On?
Temporarily, we're based on the latest version of Electron, which is based on Chromium and NodeJS. Don't worry those who may have gagged at "Chromium", we implement appropriate measures to protect your privacy! We use this because it gives us a solid foundation to work with!

[We already have plans to move engines in the future](/ABOUT.md#engine)!

# Features
Kairo comes with privacy-first features, like an adblocker, tracker blocker, fingerprinting blocker, etc.

We support Manifest v2 and Manifest v3 extensions, so you can keep your favorite extensions with Kairo, just without all the tracking.

# Release
Kairo is currently still under heavy development. Building it yourself is the only current option to use Kairo early, however there may be bugs, issues, unfinished features or features that have not been implemented at all.

On release, we will offer one release channel:
- Stable

Later on, we will have 3 release channels:
- Stable
  - The stable version of Kairo. Recommended for the average, causal users.
- Beta
  - Try Kairo versions before they come out. May ship with an beta version of Electron, which may ship with an unfinished version of Chromium. Should be stable for the most part.
- Nightly
  - Kairo will build nightly when a push is available on our GitHub repo. May ship with a beta version of Electron, which may ship with an unfinished version of Chromium. This version of Kairo is the most unstable, and may contain changes that are unfinished, or don't work at all.
